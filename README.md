## Languages used:
- HTML
- CSS

## How to approach this project:

1. Read **"README.md"** files that comes with starter files.
2. Read the **style-guide.md** file to know about fonts and colors used in the project.
3. Make variables for `font-weight`, `font-family` and `font-color`, so that you don't have to specify the exact hsl value or the exact `font-weight`, when you use them(for practicle example: see the **style.css** file in this repo.)
4. Try to use grid/flex for centering content and use the `gap` property to set space between two or more elements of same container.
5. Don't set `height`/`width` on the image first, set `width` on container and then set image-width
to **100%**.This helps to prevent overflow(i.e image cannot go out side of container.)

**Note**: These are the tips based on my personal experience and what I find easy. You are free to do it your way and also if you have any extra tips, I would love to hear.


Thank you :) & Best of luck for the challange.
